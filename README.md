# FileOrganizer

This console app will rename all the files in the directory it is put into, and name them numerically.
For example:
  Folder with files: test.txt, this.txt, idk.txt, etc.., after running this app and confirming, it will rename all the files: 0.txt, 1.txt, 2.txt, etc..
  It will not rename, nor count the app .exe itself. There is no order which file gets which number, it sorts them as the DictionaryInfo.GetFiles() passes them.
  
  
BEWARE, THIS APP IS REALLY DANGEROUS. Almost harmful, tbh.
IT CAN RENAME HUNDREDS OF FILES QUICKY WITHOUT ANY WAY TO REDO THE ACTION!
THIS CAN LEAD TO POTENTIAL SYSTEM OR OTHER PROGRAM INSTABILITY IF USED INPROPERLY!


I created this for educational purposes and also for my own use of sorting things like pictures. From random internet numerical names to short and ordered list.
